ChestShop
================================

ChestShop is an awesome plugin for managing your server's economy. 
By using chests and signs, you can effectively create your own market!

ChestShop also makes admininstators' lives easier. 
Simply drag-and-drop the .jar to your "plugins" folder and you're done! 

If you need any help - just ask. There is a ticket system, in which you can report bugs, suggest improvements and more.
Don't be fooled though - you might think that your ticket disappeared, however that's not the case.   
You should configure the system to show **"All tickets"**, instead of only **"All open"** - you can do that by clicking on the "Filters".


Building
--------------------------------

#### Installing

To build ChestShop, you'll need a Maven installation.
* [Maven download](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* Launch `mvn clean install` -- that's it!
* The built jar will be named `ChestShop-{version}.jar` (e.g., `ChestShop-3.7.9.jar`)

#### Installing external dependencies

To install external dependencies, place your .jar into the main folder and launch the `install_dependency_to_repo.sh` script - it'll guide you through the process.
